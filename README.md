## 3x3 Square Matrix in PHP

**Part I**

Using a web interface, allow web users to enter the 9 values of a Square Matrix M 3x3. 
On the server side, in PHP, you have to calculate:

- Main Diagonal (MD) = M[0][0] + M[1][1] + M[2][2]. 
- Second Diagonal (SD) = your job to figure it out.

**Part II**

Given 2 Matrices M and N, to be entered via browsers, calculate the addition of M x N. Remember that the number of columns and rows of both matrices must be equal.

**Part III**

Given 2 Matrices M and N, to do entered via browsers, calculated the product of M x N. Remember that the number of columns of the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix so they can be multiplied.
