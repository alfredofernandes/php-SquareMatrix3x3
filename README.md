**3x3 Square Matrix in PHP**

**Part I**

Using a web interface, allow web users to enter the 9 values of a Square Matrix M 3x3. 

On the server side, in PHP, you have to calculate:

Main Diagonal (MD) = M[0][0] + M[1][1] + M[2][2]. 

and the Secondary Diagonal 

SecondDiagnal (SD) formula ??? -> your job to figure it out.

**Part II**

Given 2 Matrices M and N, to be entered via browsers, calculate the addition of M x N. (Remember that the number of columns and rows of both matrices MUST be equal

**Part III**

Given 2 Matrices M and N, to do entered via browsers, calculated the product of M x N. (Remember that the number of columns of the first matrix MUST be equal to the number of rows of the second matrix so they can be multiplied.

**Reference**

For both Part I, Part II and Part III, start by researching at https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays_multi.asp and other sites that refre to PHP Arrays and Matrixes. This will be covered this week in class.
